=> Mostly Collection classes exists in three packages.
	1.	scala.collection
	2.	scala.collection.immuatable
	3. 	scala.collection.mutable
	
=> package scala.collection
	o Scala.Collection.jpg
=> package scala.collection.immutable
	o	Scala.collection.immutable.Seq.jpg
	o	Scala.collection.immutable.Set.jpg
	o	Scala.collection.immutable.Map.jpg

=> By default, Scala always picks immutable collections. If you just write Set with out any prefix, you will get
	immutable Set.
=> For mutable collections, you need to mention the package name explicitly like 
	val col = collection.mutable.Set(1,2,3)
